<h2> Welcome to my personal blog </h2>
<h2> UNI~ FAITH ~ LIFESTYLE ~ STORYTELLING </h2>
<p> I am a 19 year old christian girl who is passionate about people and loves learning about different cultures. My website is all about God, people and storytelling. </p>
<p> Life is a journey and we learn different things as we grow older, and personally, that's my favourite part about this journey, constantly growing and constantly evolving. <p>

<p> I am currently sitting at a resturant of a botanical garden (something I never imagined doing alone). This view of being surrounded by nature and people gives me so much peace and joy. Reminds me of the days I prayed for this, the blood sweat and tears into getting me this far in life. This brings me instant gratitude. Life is such a beautiful gift from God and we should be grateful that God chose us to experience it. </p>
<p> Remember to breathe and take time out of your day to look around and appreciate the gift of life. </p>
