<h1> The Creator of All </h1>
<p> There is a God part and a man part and most people usually don't get this. Here I will unpack some of the things I've learned and have grown to understand as a christian. 
<p> The christian journey isn't easy but it is worth it. It is much easier when it's done in a community.
<p> Below are the links to my main page and another one to get plugged into a church so you do this christian journey with people.
<p> To get to main page :
